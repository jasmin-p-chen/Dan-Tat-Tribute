        <p>A few years after my 30th birthday, I saw a short film about a brother and sister living in Hong Kong, on a quest to find a reincarnated goldfish called 蛋撻 or Dan Tat (pronounced daahn tāat or dàn tà). The film is called <em>Lost to Luck.</em></p>
        <p>The story stayed with me. Maybe because it reminded me of my brother who looks out for me and I love dearly. Maybe because it was made by, for and about Asians, at a time when that was pretty rare to find in Western media (It's still rare btw). Maybe it was because I was feeling pretty lost at the time, living in Brunswick in a sharehouse trying to finish a PhD.</p>

      <article><p>Mostly, I think it was because of the goldfish. It made me think of my Dad, who loved goldfish, and had a big aquarium full of them when I was young. It had been two years since he died.</br></br>I had never really understood why Dad liked keeping goldfish. Sure, they were beautiful, peaceful to watch, but I thought they lacked the personality or warmth necessary in a pet. As a kid growing up in Melbourne in the eighties, with a Chinese dad who was practically the only Chinese person I knew, I reasoned that keeping goldfish must be a 'Chinese' thing to do: whenever I saw him cleaning the tank, or sprinkling fish food I wondered if he was participating in some ancient tradition passed down from our ancestors, brush paintings of giant carp swimming in my memory.<br/><br/>You get the idea&#8212;family, Asian identity, luck, loss and second chances&#8212;this little film had a big impact on me. It's themes moved like slow ripples across my mind and eventually an odd wish started to surface: I wanted to find my own lucky fish.</p>

      <article><p>So one birthday, having heard me speak wishfully about Dan Tat, my partner took me to the local aquarium to find him. Not as romantic as the Hong Kong markets,
but it still felt vaguely magical standing in the glow of rows and rows of fish tanks. My partner beelined to a tank of two beautiful large goldfish, with tails and fins billowing elegantly behind them like chiffon. But neither of them were Dan Tat. They looked more like they would have been called Stephanie or Crystal. So began our slow parade through the aquarium, searching for what? An idea? A fish that recognised me? I really wasn't sure.</br></br>I was almost ready to give up hope when I saw him. Dan Tat, was bobbing around aimlessly in the reject tank. He was surrounded by hundreds of other under and overgrown goldfish, but it was unmistakeably him. He had a silly oversized head, which I believe made him a lionhead goldfish, though his pedigree will forever remain a mystery. He looked shyly out of the tank at me before moving in a slow funny circle and I knew. Even as a tiny fish, to me he had an inner glow. He was the most beautiful orange and his big eyes seemed full of meaning. 
        </p>
        <p>For six wonderful years, Dan Tat was my lucky fish, first sitting beside me in a bowl on my desk, and then very shortly after that, as he grew rapidly in confidence and girth, in a large tank beside my desk. He had a personality as big as his appetite, his favourite things to eat being water cabbages and baby peas. I did not expect to love a goldfish so dearly. A great listener, a patient friend, a buoyant blob of sunshine. Vale Dan Tat, you had a golden spirit and a heart as lionlike as your head.
